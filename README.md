# OpenAction Element Call

This repository contains an OpenAction plugin that provides basic actions for controlling [Element Call](https://call.element.io).

You will need to install a userscript manager of your choice, such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), in your browser and add the contents of `client.js` in this repository as a userscript.
If you use Firefox, you will need to set `network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS` to `true` from `about:config`.

Currently available actions:
- Toggle mic
- Toggle camera
